          <p>
            A motivated passionate individual with the ability to multitask, Iâ€™m
            a person that thrives on energy and hard work. At the moment, I am
            working as a service desk analyst at a logistics company. Inmy spare
            time, I find pleasure and challenge in learning and applying
            different web technologies. My center of interest is JavaScript,
            particularly the MERN stack and everything connected to it. However,
            trying to keep things versatile, I also have a fond interest in OOP
            languages such as Java and C#. Outside of work, I enjoy writing
            code, running, hiking and watching classic movies.
