          <p>
            A motivated passionate individual with the ability to multitask, Iâ€™m
            a person that thrives on energy and hard work. At the moment, I am
            working as a .NET software developer. In my spare time, I find
            pleasure and challenge in learning and applying different web
            technologies. My center of interest is JavaScript, particularly the
            MERN stack and everything connected to it. However, trying to keep
            things versatile, I also have a fond interest in OOP languages such
            as Java and C#. Outside of work, I enjoy writing code, running,
            hiking and watching classic movies.
